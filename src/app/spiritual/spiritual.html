				<h5 id='whatis'>What is a Spiritual Life Team (SLT)? What happens at SLT Meetings?
				</h5>
				<h5>Why would I want to be a member of a SLT? Why are SLTs necessary?  
				</h5>
				<p>These are questions most SLT members would welcome.
				</p>
				<p>Learning more about Spiritual Life Teams by visiting the Spiritual Health Center Website below and meet Dr. Bobbie McKay who created the concept of Spiritual Life Teams.
				</p>

				<p>For 23 years, The Spiritual Health Center has studied the spiritual lives of over 4,000 people in mainstream, Protestant, Catholic, Reform Jewish, and Muslim congregations.
				</p>
				<h3>What we discovered,</h3>
				<p>was simple and profound: People have experiences of the presence or action of God which are life-transforming, meaning God becomes real to them. But people rarely, if ever, share these experiences for fear of being perceived as weird, crazy, or too religious.
				</p>
				<h3>Our passion and our mission is to ignite that spiritual energy and light up the world with God's presence.</h3>
</p>
<p>We offer FIVE PROGRAMS which have proven incredibly effective in developing the spiritual lives of people in all circumstances, faith traditions and cultures. These programs can transform your life: God can become real for you. And the spiritual connections you form will make God real in the world.
