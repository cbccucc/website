				<h2>Spiritual Life</h2>
				<h4>Spritual Life Teams</h4>
				<p>For 23 years, The Spiritual Health Center has studied the spiritual lives of over 4,000 people in mainstream, Protestant, Catholic, Reform Jewish, and Muslim congregations.
				</p>
				<h4>What we discovered,</h4>
				<p>was simple and profound: People have experiences of the presence or action of God which are life-transforming, meaning God becomes real to them. But people rarely, if ever, share these experiences for fear of being perceived as weird, crazy, or too religious.
				</p>
				<h4>Our passion and our mission is to ignite that spiritual energy and light up the world with God's presence.</h4>
</p>
<p>We offer FIVE PROGRAMS which have proven incredibly effective in developing the spiritual lives of people in all circumstances, faith traditions and cultures. These programs can transform your life: God can become real for you. And the spiritual connections you form will make God real in the world.
