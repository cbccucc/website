			<h3>CBCC STEWARDSHIP PLEDGES</h3>
			<p>
			We are grateful for the generosity of our members and friends who make up the congregation of Cocoa Beach Community Church.  It truly takes all of us working together to allow us to continue to provide for all the needs of our church and the needs of those in our community who depend on us. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Stewardship is about making choices, as individuals and in community.  It is more than giving money to the church. Stewardship is about being faithful disciples, caring for and managing all that God has given us.  Stewardship is the grateful response to God’s grace and goodness.  It requires a consideration of how our choices affect us and others, of how we can be good caretakers of the created world, and of how we can best serve God and disciples of Christ.
