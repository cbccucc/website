				Since 1965 the Community Church has served Cocoa Beach by operating our Thrift Shop.  We started as a couple of women sitting at a card table after church selling baby clothes.  Today we five rooms packed to the rafters with clothing, glassware, decorative items, linens, books, records, DVDs, collectibles and holiday decorations.
				</p>
				<h3 id='purpose'>The purpose of the Thrift Shop is two fold:</h3>
				<ol>
						<li>to offer very reasonably priced household items and clothing to our community members</li>
				<li>
				to raise funds so that our church can serve the world with our outreach projects
				</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 id='distribute'>
